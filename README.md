# Nurtur-Model

In this project, we've developed models to detect facial mood and enter which classes "angry, angry, sad, surprise, happy, fear, neutral" recognize what faces the user is showing. It contains a transfer learning model named resnet50v2 that we use to improve our accuracy by using the correct tuning method. We could train or model 100 epochs We got the results:
